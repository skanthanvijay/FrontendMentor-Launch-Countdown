## My process

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- Sass
- Node

### What I learned

Using code from other people's packages makes it significantly easier to create for example, the working flipclock. This project would have taken far longer if I tried to make the flipclock work from scratch.

### Continued development

This is my first project using React. For a future project, I'd like to make a react app that uses more backend applications.

### Useful resources

- [The Complete Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) - This course helped me learn how to use React as well as most other web development concepts I have used.
